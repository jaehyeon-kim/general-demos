[Serverless Application Model (SAM) for Data Professionals](https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-07-18-sam-for-data-professionals/)

- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) provides serverless computing capabilities and it can be used for performing validation or light processing/transformation of data. Moreover, with its integration with more than 140 AWS services, it facilitates building complex systems employing [event-driven architectures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/event-driven-architectures.html). There are many ways to build serverless applications and one of the most efficient ways is using specialised frameworks such as the [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) and [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs). In this post, Iâ€™ll demonstrate how to build a serverless data processing application using SAM.
